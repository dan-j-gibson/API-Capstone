A summary section. This should have a concise explanation of what your app does. Try to frame this from the standpoint of what the user does, or what the app enables for the user.
- App takes two user inputs; location and radius from location and returns a list of fires with name, size, cause, containment and distance away for each fire in that radius. The welcome screen contains an imbedded map of the US showing active fires. Map is focused on the west coast where most fires are. Users can determine their or a specific location's fire safety level at the current time and track changes in real time.
A section on the technology used. For your capstone, this is fairly simple (HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery) but it's still good to list out the key technologies.
